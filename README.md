# forestcore-assets
in april I took part in quarantine jam where you have to create a game with 48 hours based on a prompt. I was the artist and we came up with a game where you have to choose your own weapons before defending against packs of enemies. Here are the assets that I've created. If you want to check our submission, here is the linkhttps://itch.io/jam/ndab-jam/rate/632852
